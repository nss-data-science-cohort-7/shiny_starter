# R Shiny Starter Project

The purpose of this exercise if for you to become familiar with the basics of building an R Shiny application.

Select a dataset that we have used on a prior exercise or project. Build a Multiple File application using this dataset.

Your app should have at least one interactive visualization (meaning that the user should be able to interact with your application to update this visualization). Don't feel like you have to limit yourself to just one visualization if you have time to add more.

Once your app has been created, deploy it to shinyapps.io.
